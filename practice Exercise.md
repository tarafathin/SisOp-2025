Practice exercise:
1.1	What are the three main purposes of an operating system?
•	Running programs and managing computer resources.
•	Controlling access to hardware such as the CPU, memory, and storage devices.
•	Providing a user-friendly environment for users and developers.
1.2	We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use of the computing hardware. When is it appropriate for the operating system to forsake this principle and to "waste" resources? Why is such a system not really wasteful?
•	Graphical User Interface (GUI) is slower than the command line but easier to use.
•	Multitasking allows multiple programs to run at once, even though it reduces performance slightly.
1.3	What is the main difficulty that a programmer must overcome in writing an operating system for a real-time environment?
•	The main challenge in writing a real-time operating system is ensuring that all tasks are completed within a strict time limit. If a task takes too long, the system may fail.
1.4	Keeping in mind the various definitions of operating system, consider whether the operating system should include applications such as web browsers and mail programs. Argue both that it should and that it should not, and support your answers.
•	Yes: It makes things easier for users by providing essential applications.
•	No: This is not the primary function of an OS and may make it larger and harder to manage.
1.5	How does the distinction between kernel mode and user mode function as a rudimentary form of protection (security)?
•	Kernel mode and user mode separate important system operations from normal user operations. This helps security by preventing user programs from directly accessing critical system data.
1.6	Which of the following instructions should be privileged?
a. Set value of timer= Yes, because it changes the system time.
b. Read the clock= No, just reading information.
c. Clear memory= Yes, it may cause data loss.
d. Issue a trap instruction= Yes, because it changes program execution.
e. Turn off interrupts= Yes, it can disrupt the system.
f. Modify entries in the device-status table=Yes, since it modifies device settings.
g. Switch from user to kernel mode= Yes, only the OS should change the mode.
h. Access I/O device= Yes, as it accesses hardware devices.
1.7	Some early computers protected the operating system by placing it in a memory partition that could not be modified by either the user job or the operating system itself. Describe two difficulties that you think could arise with such a scheme.
•	Lack of flexibility if the partition size is too small.
•	Difficulty in updating or modifying the OS since the memory is fixed.
1.8	Some CPUs provide for more than two modes of operation. What are two possible uses of these multiple modes?
•	User mode = Runs regular programs.
•	Kernel mode = Executes OS tasks that require full hardware access.
1.9	Timers could be used to compute the current time. Provide a short description of how this could be accomplished.
•	The OS sets a timer to trigger a signal every second.
•	When the timer reaches a set value, the system updates the time.
1.10	Give two reasons why caches are useful. What problems do they solve? What problems do they cause? If a cache can be made as large as the device for which it is caching (for instance, a cache as large as a disk), why not make it that large and eliminate the device?
Benefit :
•	Speeds up access to frequently used data.
•	Reduces the load on main memory.
Ploblems:
•	Expensive to produce in large sizes.
•	If too large, search time may increase.
1.11	Distinguish between the client-server and peer-to-peer models of distributed systems.
Client-server model :
•	A central server provides services to clients.
•	Example: Websites, cloud services.
Peer-to-peer model :
•	Every computer can act as both a server and a client.
•	Example: Torrent, direct file sharing.
